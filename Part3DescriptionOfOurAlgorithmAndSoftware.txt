Our algorithm is seprated into two parts.
The first part computes the Distance Matrix.
The second part computes the Phylogentic Tree.

For the first part we read the input file and store the data using the preprocess function. 
Then using the data we have we compute the LCS for each sequence to every other sequence using the distance_matrix function.
We store this LCS data inside of a distance matrix which is a numpy array which is then stored into a file called distance_matrix.npy.
We will then use this file for our second part.

For the second part we load the distance_matrix.npy files data.
We process this data and use the clust function to perfrom what is know as agglomerative clustering.
agglomerative clustering is a bottom up approach of grouping data.
Once our data is grouped correctly, we pass this data to the augmented_dendrogram function.
The augmented_dendrogram function uses pythons libraries scipy and matplotlib.pyplot to plot the data.
Once the data is plotted it is stored in a file called PyhlogeneticTreePicture.png which shows the image of the phylogenetic tree that is created.
