Based on the image in PyhlogeneticTreePicture.png and the image the website has, we concluded that our
combination of lcs and agglomerative clustering is extremly accurate beacuse our Phylogentic Tree is
identical to the one found on  https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/‚Äù when using the input file "tulp3relatives.txt"
A comparison between the two graphs can be found in this file: 4110_assignment3_trees.pdf
