The tupl3 gene "encodes a member of the tubby gene family of bipartite transcription factors". The tupl3 protein "binds to phosphoinositides in the plasma membrane via its C-terminal region and probably functions as a membrane-bound transcription regulator that translocates to the nucleus in response to phosphoinositide hydrolysis, for instance, induced by G-protein-coupled-receptor signaling."
