Our source for lcs is: 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-common-substring-dp-29/

Our source for the generateLcsMatrix.py file is:
https://github.com/SupriyaL/Hierarchical-Clustering/blob/master/Preprocess.py

Our source for the generateTree.py file is:
https://github.com/SupriyaL/Hierarchical-Clustering/blob/master/code_1.py



1) The LCS code is provided in a file called lcs.py
2) To test lcs.py, one must pass in a command line argument that represents the file name that is being read from.
    To execute lcs.py:
        python3 lcs.py <filename>
3) There are two programs utilized to generate the phylogenetic tree: GenerateTree.py and GenerateLcsMatrix.py. A python script called script.py is provided to run these programs. The filename containing the protein sequences must be passed in as a command line argument.
  To execute script.py:
    python3 script.py <filename>
  
The phylogenetic tree that is generated is contained in a file called       PyhlogeneticTreePicture.png.
  
4) A pdf is provided that compares our tree with the tree that was generated with https://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/.
