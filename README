1) The LCS code is provided in a file called lcs.py
2) To test lcs.py, one must pass in a command line argument that represents the file name that is being read from.
    To execute lcs.py:
        python lcs.py <filename>
3) There are two programs utilized to generate the phylogenetic tree: GenerateTree.py and GenerateLcsMatrix.py. A python script called script.py is provided to run these programs. The filename containing the protein sequences must be passed in as a command line argument.
  To execute script.py:
    python script.py <filename>
  
The phylogenetic tree that is generated is contained in a file called "PyhlogeneticTreePicture.png".
